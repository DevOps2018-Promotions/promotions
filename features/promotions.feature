Feature: The promotion service back-end
    As a Promotion Service Owner
    I need a RESTful API service
    So that I can keep track of all my promotions

Background:
    Given the following promotions
        | id | name         | product_id | discount_ratio |
        |  1 | BlackFriday  | 9999       | 99             |
        |  2 | July4th      | 1785       | 74             |
        |  3 | BackToSchool | 1831       | 80             |

Scenario: The server is running
    When I visit the "Home Page"
    Then I should see "Promotion Demo REST Service" in the title
    And I should not see "404 Not Found"
